# Student GWA Reader
This is a Python program that reads a file containing the name of 20 students together with their GWA (Grade Weighted Average). The program will output the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA).

# How to Run the Program
To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Download or copy the code into a new Python file and save it as "student_gwa_reader.py".
2. Create or copy a text file named "studentgwa.txt" I provided and enter the name of each student and their corresponding GWA separated by a space on each line. 
3. Save the "studentgwa.txt" file in the same directory as the "student_gwa_reader.py" file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the "student_gwa_reader.py" file is located.
5. Run the command python student_gwa_reader.py to execute the program.

# Output
The program will output the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA) and the GWA of the user (if found). If the user's name is not found in the "studentgwa.txt" file, the program will output a message indicating that the user's GWA could not be found.

# Why I Created This Program
As a computer engineering student, I often need to calculate and analyze data, including student GWA. I created this program as a tool to easily and quickly find the student with the highest GWA and to look up the GWA of a specific student in a large list of student data.

# IDE and Visual Studio Code
This program can be run in any Python IDE, such as PyCharm, Spyder, or IDLE. To run the program in Visual Studio Code, open the "student_gwa_reader.py" file and press F5 to run the program in the integrated terminal. Alternatively, you can open the integrated terminal and navigate to the directory where the "student_gwa_reader.py" file is located, then run the command python student_gwa_reader.py.
